# CDL
CDL is the new Microsoft XNA, but first a little backstory. I always loved coding in C# with Microsoft XNA but I always thought it could do better, like with better 3d support and  more tutorials. Well thats CDL aka C#/C++ Drawing Libary. CDL has two versions one is Made in C++ and C# using OpenGl and is used with C#, The other version is made in C++ and is just used for C++.
