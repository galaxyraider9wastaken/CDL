# CDL
CDL is the new Microsoft XNA, but first a little backstory. I always loved coding in C# with Microsoft XNA but I always thought it could do better, like with better 3d support and  more tutorials. Well thats CDL aka C#/C++ Drawing Libary. CDL has two versions one is Made in C++ and C# using OpenGl and is used with C#, The other version is made in C++ and is just used for C++.

# Looking at the code
Looking at the source code can be confusing, basicly the project is split into two folders one is called CSDL aka C Sharp Drawing Library and the other is called CPPDL aka C Plus Plus Drawing Library. Inside each folder their is many folders but two of them are important here modules, modules is only in CSDL but in modules is were all the C# files go and in API is were the cpp files go keep in mind this is for CSDL in CPPDL there is only one important folder no module folder. The other importatnt folder is API, API is where the CPP files are and the egine files, this may change at some point but for now this is where it stands. You may also notice most of the folders are empty or have only a few things or lack of code, that is beacause we have just started development and have not completed many files.
