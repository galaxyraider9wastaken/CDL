# CDL
CDL is the new Microsoft XNA, but first a little backstory. I always loved coding in C# with Microsoft XNA but I always thought it could do better, like with better 3d support and  more tutorials. Well thats CDL aka C#/C++ Drawing Libary. CDL has two versions one is Made in C++ and C# using OpenGl and is used with C#, The other version is made in C++ and is just used for C++.

# Looking at the code
Looking at the source code can be confusing, basicly the project is split into two folders one is called CSDL aka C Sharp Drawing Library and the other is called CPPDL aka C Plus Plus Drawing Library. Inside each folder their is many folders but two of them are important here modules which are the extra librarys that have nothing to do with graphics and the API folder that is where the graphics engine goes, this may change at some point but for now this is where it stands. You may also notice most of the folders are empty or have only a few things or lack of code, that is beacause we just started devolopment and have not completed many files.
