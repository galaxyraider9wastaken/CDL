# CDL
CDL is the new Microsoft XNA, but first a little backstory. I always loved coding in C# with Microsoft XNA but I always thought it could do better, like with better 3d support and  more tutorials. Well thats CDL aka C#/C++ Drawing Libary. CDL has two versions one is Made in C++ and C# using OpenGl and is used with C#, The other version is made in C++ and is just used for C++.

# Looking at the code
Looking at the source code can be confusing, basicly the project is split into two folders one is called CSDL aka C Sharp Drawing Library and the other is called CPPDL aka C Plus Plus Drawing Library.
