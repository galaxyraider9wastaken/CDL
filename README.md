# CDL
CDL is the new Microsoft XNA! I always loved coding in C# with Microsoft XNA but I always thought it could do better, like with better 2d drawing functions and make it easier to learn and more tutorials. CDL is Made in C++ and C# using SFML. Sadly no 3D beacuse I suck at opengl mabey in a later update.
